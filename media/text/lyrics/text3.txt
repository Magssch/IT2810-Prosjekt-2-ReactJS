{"number":3,"title": "Love Story","artist":"Taylor Swift","text": "We were both young when I first saw you\nI close my eyes and the flashback starts\nI'm standing there on a balcony in summer air\n\nSee the lights, see the party, the ball gowns\nSee you make your way through the crowd\nAnd say hello\n\nLittle did I know\nThat you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\nAnd I was crying on the staircase\nBegging you, please, don't go\n\nAnd I said,\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\"\nI'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story, baby just say yes\n\nSo I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo close your eyes, escape this town for a little while\n'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said \"Stay away from Juliet\"\nBut you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go\n\nAnd I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story baby just say yes\n\nRomeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult, but it's real\nDon't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story, baby just say \"Yes\""}
